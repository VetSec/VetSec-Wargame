#### README for Module 3 ####
#############################

# Exploit derived from: https://samsclass.info/127/proj/p6-fs.htm
# POC template from: https://samsclass.info/127/proj/p6-fs.htm (additional examples included)

To set this Module up, please run sudo ./setup first.

The goal of this Module is to show you what format string exploitation is like, and give some introduction to different ways you could exploit a program utilizing this method.

Please feel free to explore and/or play with the source code in the files (.c) provided to have a better understanding of what things look like on a developer side. To recompile a program if you choose to modify any of the .c source code files, just re-run 'sudo ./setup'.

Usage Information

- The following POC scripts are intended to be ran in gdb and stepped through, observing the effects
* poc_44434241.py
* poc_shellcode_1.py
* USAGE: run $(./poc.py)

- All other POC scripts can be ran outside of GDB
* USAGE: ./fmtstring $(./poc.py)

- The README in Exploit_Stuff has additional useful commands for exploring how a format string functions.

- Additional Resources to aid in learning include:

Module Information

- Source code for exploit and program are found in the '.c' extension programs.

- The folder labled 'Vulnerable Program' holds the program that is vulnerable that we will be exploiting.

- The folder labled 'Exploit Stuff' holds the different methods of how to exploit the vulnerable program in their respective folders.
