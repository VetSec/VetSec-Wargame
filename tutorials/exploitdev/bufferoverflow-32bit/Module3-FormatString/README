# POC template from: https://samsclass.info/127/proj/p6-fs.htm (additional examples included)

To set this Module up, please run sudo ./setup first.

The goal of this Module is to show you what format string exploitation is like, and give some introduction to different ways you could exploit a program utilizing this method.

Please feel free to explore and/or play with the source code in the files (.c) provided to have a better understanding of what things look like on a developer side. To recompile a program if you choose to modify any of the .c source code files, just re-run 'sudo ./setup'.
